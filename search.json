One day in late June\n\n\n\nToday’s a long-awaited Eichi Day!1\nIt’s super rare for all four of us in fine to have the day off together~♪\n\nWataru\nI don’t know if it was “KIRAKIRA” or “TEKATEKA,” but it sounds like you had a wonderful time in that unique unit. I heard you looked happier than you ever do in fine♪\n\n\nFufufu! Could it be jealousy, Eichi?\nYou’re the one who left the birdcage open. If you dislike me perching on other trees so much, perhaps you should have joined the Audition yourself?\n\n...Wait, why’s it getting so tense!?\nHey Yuzuru~! Do something about this atmosphere!\n\n\nEven if you say that to me...\nEichi-sama, Hibiki-sama. I don’t know what has transpired between you two, but please don’t make young master feel uncomfortable\n\nOh. My apologies, Tori, Yuzuru\nI trusted Wataru and sent him off, but it seems I’m not handling the idea of this NiceP producing him as well as I thought\n\nOh my. That’s quite the bitter face you’re making, Eichi~ Today feels like the day spears might fall from the sky!\n\nSpears aren’t gonna fall! You’re so dramatic\n\nOh? If you ask it of me, Hibiki Wataru can even make spears rain from above\nAnd! Thanks to the guidance of that Nice fellow, I can now deliver an even more polished, splendid show!\n\nI didn’t say you should actually do it!?\nWait, can NiceP’s coaching really change someone that much in just a few days?\nWell, he is a world-class producer, so maybe that much is to be expected\nI saw the “PIKAPIKA” video the other day. Hibiki-senpai, you were so amazing it made me a little jealous\nThe Nice Dream Units chosen in 4piece, every one of them was incredible\nIt really is a massive Audition program. I hate to admit it, but you can feel NiceP’s strength as a producer\nI feel like I got to see a new side of Hibiki-senpai I didn’t know before\n\nFufu. Entering in honor of the princess’s will, I was terribly nervous. Did I manage to save a bit of face?\n\nLiar~ You totally weren’t nervous! You were acting all carefree the whole time!\nIt was only at the very end that you finally got serious\n\nI was only wearing a mask. I may not look it, but I’m delicate, you know☆\n\nSetting Wataru’s nonsense aside, we’ve learned that fine still has much room to grow\nIn that sense, I’m grateful to 4piece. It let me witness Wataru’s evolution\nIf I could be greedy, I would’ve preferred to see that evolution within fine\n\nYour words are dripping with poison, Eichi-sama\n\nI didn’t mean it that way—or did I?\nLook at that. The trending Nice Dream Unit video is playing all over the front page\n\nYou’re right! Hibiki-senpai is singing and dancing!\n\nFufu. I never thought 4piece would draw this much attention\n\n“Attention, viewers of this broadcast! Pardon the interruption!”\n\n\nNngyo!?\nWhat is that? A video hijack…!?\n\nIt appears so. They’ve swapped in some sort of Nice Dream Unit promotional video from somewhere\n\n\n“Thanks to idols, staff, and of course you viewers, 4piece ended in great success, and I am truly grateful”\n“At the same time, here in this country, I plan to launch a new joint project between Thunderbolt and ES”\n“The announcement is scheduled three days from now, at 15:00 JST! Please look forward to it!”\n\n\nWhat the heck… A new Thunderbolt and ES joint project…?\n\nEichi-sama, have you heard anything of this?\n\nNo. Thunderbolt and ES have a comprehensive contract. Within its terms, NiceP is granted discretion\nThat includes announcing and carrying out projects\nWe have no right to control his every move, nor does he need our permission each time\n\nEh? So NiceP can just do whatever he wants at ES for now?\n\nOf course, we’re being compensated appropriately\nAnd naturally, I didn’t agree to anything outrageous\nAs ES office heads, we retain the authority to keep our idols from participating in Thunderbolt’s projects\nIf NiceP ever acts against my ideals, against what suits ES, I won’t remain silent\n\nStill, NiceP sure loves to pull annoying surprise announcements\nJust because he’s from some huge overseas company, he thinks he can look down on us. Eichi-sama’s the one who’s built up ES till now, isn’t he?\n(But)\n(If NiceP is starting another project, that means I might have a chance too)\n(A project that made Hibiki-senpai grow, a project even Eichi-sama envied—I could be part of it)\n(I missed out when I withdrew back then)\n(But if I get another chance—)\n\n—Young master?\n\nAh, no! it’s nothing!\nI just thought maybe that troublemaking producer is scheming up something flashy again?\nAnyway, let’s go! It’d be a waste not to enjoy our precious day off, right?\n\nIndeed. Let’s end the work talk here and savor this valuable holiday\nAfter enduring the fierce Audition battles and wrapping up “PIKAPIKA” activities, now is the perfect time to stretch our wings\nSoon enough, there will likely be new developments. For now, let the four of us here enjoy a peaceful, ordinary day together...☆\n\nChapter 2\n\n   At the same time, at the Cafe Cinnamon in the ES Bulding\n\n\n\n(A new project to replace “4piece”, sure smells fishy to me)\n(I hear Mr. Nice Arneb Thunder2, better known as “NiceP”─became a man of the hour starting with “4piece”, thanks to his earnest and gentlemanly conduct)\n(Even if he moved his base overseas after retiring as an idol, it’s strange how domestic media ignored him for so long)\n(It must have been the media pandering to this country’s idol industry. NiceP was on the verge of being forgotten at home)\n(I only ever heard rumors while traveling overseas myself...)\n(If I remember correctly, nowadays a unit called “Mellow Dear Us” is popular in his place?)\n(A former super idol and now a world-class producer. He’s been active on all fronts, like the protagonist of a story)\n(Am I just being twisted for finding something fishy in such a smooth-sailing path?)\n(It began with reforming the “P-Association,” then bringing in Anzu-san, who’s highly trusted by idols, to hold the 4piece program. As a result, they’ve even infiltrated the depths of ES)\n(Even if the other side has immense capital, Eichi-san and Ibara-san’s eyes can’t be so blind as to accept their invasion head-on)\n(The ES executives understand the current situation and are letting it be)\n(No, perhaps it’s better to say they can’t intervene)\n(The people of this country have always admired foreign goods, but if uncritical praise goes too far, it becomes poison)\n(I don’t know what Eichi-san and the others are doing behind the scenes. But maybe I should make some moves myself?)\n(For example, what if I got in touch with someone who knew NiceP during his idol days?)\n(Normally, they’d be around here一)\n\n\nSorry to keep you waiting~♪\nI brought freshly baked pizza, so let’s eat it while it’s hot~♪\n\n\nRinne-han...... do ya even know what ya did?\n\n一An unbelievable blunder. It wouldn’t be strange if you were forced to take responsibility?\n\n\nSorry! It was my bad! Just spare me the violence, seriously!\n\nEhh, eh. What’s going on!?\nRinne-kun being at fault is nothing new, but Cinnamon is a proper café, so don’t bring dangerous stuff up here!\n\n\nIt ain’t “as always.” But yeah, this time really was my mistake\n\n?That’s rare? For Rinne-kun to apologize honestly\n\nNaturally. Amagi didn’t even consider participating in 4piece\nI heard from the deputy director. Cos Pro was preparing to take on the audition as an agency―\nYet only Valkyrie and Crazy:B didn’t even send a reply\n\nMe and HiMERU-han couldn’ go either way, we had work\nStill, ES and Thunderbolt joined hands to create a huge project, we could’ve at least mentioned it, don’t you think\n\nNot conforming to the big current is Crazy:B’s virtue. But Amagi himself wouldn’t want to be left behind\n\nOhh. That’s nice of ya, Merumeru♪ You praising Crazy:B to my face, huh\n\nDon’t joke around. Why didn’t Amagi mention “4piece”\n\nThere ain’t any hidden reason. This time it was just my poor judgment\nYou and Kohaku-chan seemed busy with PBB, would you be interested in the Audition anyway?\nI never planned on joining, and Niki’s juggling being a cook and idol. For us right now, it just didn’t seem that important\n\n\nThat’s a lie, the truth is, you’ve got some history with NiceP, don’t you?\n\nWhoae!? Since when were you there!?\nJumping in from the side like that’s bad for my heart! At least say something if you’re there!\n\nI was patiently watching! You all seemed to be having such an intense conversation, so I was observing♪\n\nPretty twisted of ya. Watching my disgrace on purpose like that\nSo? What is it, you want something with Kohaku-chan or what?\nKohaku-chan belongs to us, Crazy:B, ya know? If you want him back, you better show some proper sincerity?\n\nEh? who said I “belonged” to Crazy:B? This ain’ Hana Ichimonme3\n\nHahaha! You’re clearly trying to change the subject? Looks like you’ve got something on your mind, Rinne-san\nFrom here on, I’ll be asking, no, interrogating you\nAnd I want everyone here to act as witnesses\n\nWhat’s with ya, Madara-han, making it sound so grand… Are ya saying Rinne-han did anything?\n\nOh, nothing serious. Nothing against the law, nothing against reason\nA story the world has forgotten. I came to dig it up\nRinne-san. Back in your idol days, ya were in the same agency and debuted together as peers with NiceP, aka Yoshihide Sanda, weren’t you?\nCan you tell me about that time in detail?\n\nWith NiceP, in the same agency…?\n\nWait, seriously, Rinne-kun!?\nIf I remember, Rinne-kun, you worked as a solo idol for a while, but you never really told me much about that, right?\nCould it be you actually knew some huge name?\n\nNow that it’s mentioned, you’re the same age. The timing and age fit, but to think you were that close...\nCould that really be the reason you didn’t tell us about 4piece?\n\nNo it ain’t. Niki never cared about the industry from the start, and 4piece just happened\n...Tch, wonder where you sniffed that out from\nFinee. Wasn’t hiding it anyway. I’ll tell ya as much as ya want\nThough it’s just some worthless tall tale, nothing worth digging up\n\nChapter 3\n\nNow that it’s mentioned, you’re the same age. The timing and age fit, but to think you were that close...\nCould that really be the reason you didn’t tell us about 4piece?\n\nTranslation Notes\n\n        ⌂\n        ←\n        ⌂\n        →\n        ↑\n↑ During Tempest, fine members are working a lot and don’t have time to spend together, specially Eichi.

On the main street, outside of the Grand Hall where SS took place.\n\n\n\n(Sighhhhhhhh, what ‘m gonna doooo-)\n(Oshi-san’ll be mad atme~ No, instead of gettin’ mad atme, lately Oshi-san’s been so sweet with me that &#39;s givin’ me the chills, but he&#39;s still gonna scold me~)\n(He’ll abandon me~ I can just imagine Oshi-san’s face lookin’ atme with scorn~)\n\n\n.....♪\n(Wait a sec, why am I smilin’?! I need t’ think of somethin’, no matter what it is!)\n(Oshi-san’s returnin’ t’ Japan at noon, so I wanna make a solid plan before he gets here!)\n(I can hear him already~ “What have you even been doing until now? If you’ve been acting like nothing but a lifeless corpse, then I suppose I should have held a funeral for you.”)\n(I suppose that type of sarcasm is just right fer someone who’s well-bred…)\n.....♪\n(Nnha, this ain’t the time t’ get excited! I gotta think about what I need t’ think!)\n(Nnaaaa, God, why didn’t ya put a smarter brain in my head?!)\n(Aah… As I thought, it’s impossible to create my own art~)\n(If I try to imitate Oshi-san, I’d be nothin’ but a cheap façade.)\n\n“Amazing! For all the people on my left and on my right, and for every beautiful being that walks like migratory birds, If you’re not running against life, enjoy my art!”\n\n(Art? Is someone sellin’ art in the street like this?)\nHuh? Isn’t that Oshi-san’s friend一\n\n\nOya? Oya Oya Oya? It looks like we’ve met in an unexpected place, Doll-san!\n\nNna? I’m happy ya call me like that, but I’m not a doll anymore.\nNow, I need t’ live as a proper human, as I vowed durin’ the Repayment Festival\n\nOh? We, fine, were not too involved with the repayment festival, so we didn’t know much about the details―\nSo that&#39;s how it ended up after all?\nShould this be said to be a non-normal act of Shu, or rather a normal one?\nThis is the type of contradiction that art holds\nThe more one pursues art, the loftier the work becomes, and the more distant it becomes from human beings. And it is only when humans determine its value that art can be considered art\nAn artist truly is a thin, transparent thread that connects never-changing eternity to our own transient world! Amazing...☆\n\nNnha? Ok, if ya say so, but… What’re you doin’ here, Hibiki-senpai?\nIt looks like you’re doin’ a street performance or somethin’, but are you doin’ work around here?\n\nNo, no! Today is “Eichi Day”1, so I’m also enjoying my personal time!\n\nEichi Da–y?\n\nFufufu. It&#39;s a special and important holiday for us fine, don&#39;t you know?\n\nNo, I don&#39;t know. Now that I think about it, I think I read in a magazine article that the members of &quot;fine&quot; have been spendin’ their days off together\nI&#39;ve been doin’ a lot of gravure shoots lately, so I&#39;ve been gettin’ a lot of complimentary copies of the magazines I work for\n\nThat&#39;s right! We call that day off &quot;Eichi Day&quot;. It&#39;s a special code only known among us fine\n\nAhaha. As usual, it seems like the namin’ sense of the Student Council President’s exquisite, it was the same case fer DDD an’ MDM\nWait, that guy isn’t the President anymore. Eeh, ‘s Tenshouin Eichi-san, right?\nDoin’ something like namin’ a holiday after yerself just shows how he’s still trying to put himself in the spotlight somehow\n\nWell, Eichi is an idol after all, that’s our role. Maybe he was just influenced by me, who is always trying to be under the spotlight\n\nI mean, s’just bad pun usin’ holiday… From the “eh” in “H”- day t’Eichi-day. Sounds kinda dumb\n\nFufufu. Actually, he wasn’t the one who brought up the idea of calling it “Eichi day”\nWell, I won&#39;t deny that it&#39;s a very Eichi-esque name\nSpeaking of him, Eichi has been repeatedly admitted to and discharged from the hospital recently due to fatigue from the summer\nWe love to have Eichi by our side, but when he’s around, he acts tough and pushes himself too hard\nSo we are spending our time happily and joyfully, communicating with each other through Hall Hands and other means\nThe world is so beautiful and lovely, so please come back soon, Eichi\nFortunately or perhaps unfortunately, we’ve gotten used to Eichi&#39;s absence... Even without him, we have set up the activities of fine so that they can continue somehow\nIt&#39;s truly lonely and unfortunate. Just when we were about to start walking together, we had to separate\n\nFufu. Well, there’s nothin’ ya can do with his health the way it is\nLast year, we, Valkyrie, were both in bad condition too, an’ there were times when we couldn&#39;t perform on stages that we wanted t’ perform on\n\nFufufu. Such a thing is common amongst artists, isn’t it? They tend to put their whole heart and soul into the work in front of them, and forget about their own “self”\nEven though for us idols, our “self” is our selling point\n\n.....♪\n\nOya? What&#39;s wrong, why are you grinning? Did I say something amusing? Can you tell me what it is?\n\nNnha, ‘s not that… I was just thinkin’ about how easy it is to talk with ya, even though I’m shy when it comes to people &#39;m not that close to, Hibiki-senpai\nI guess ‘s because yer pretty similar to Oshi-san, bein’ his friend an’ all♪\n\nMe, similar to Shu? That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever been insulted in such a way, and I&#39;ll never forgive it! My beloved doves, teach that fool a lesson!\n\n\nAhhh!? I- I- I-I&#39;m sorry, ‘m so sorry! Don’t set yer doves on meee! How are ya even doin’ that!? Are you a circus animal tamer?\n\nFufufu. Doves are intelligent creatures, so if you train them well, you can control them however you like\nI personally hatched those pigeons from their eggs, fed them delicious meals, and taught them everything from how to stand to how to walk\n\nNnha~ So ’s like the way Oshi-san raised me, I suddenly feel like I have a real connection with them\n\nNo, in my eyes, me and Shu, and you and the doves are completely different\n\nNnha~ do ya hate t’ be compared with Oshi-san, Hibiki-senpai? Well, I guess y’all had a tough time two years ago\nY’all were thrown in the trash as &quot;things the world doesn&#39;t need”一\n\nGoodness, you&#39;re acting like it was someone else&#39;s business entirely. You were also a victim, but perhaps your sense of self had not yet developed at the time\nJust like your predecessor, the blonde-haired Doll-san\n\n........Are ya talkin’ about the stuff involvin’ Nazuna-nii? Or Mado-nee?\n\nIt could apply to both. Humans have a hard time telling the difference between male and female birds, because humans have a hard time becoming interested in or attached to things that are far away from us\nI believe that&#39;s why Shu made you into a &quot;human&quot;, you know\n\n...?\n\nChapter 2\n\nteste\n\n\n        ⌂\n        ←\n        ⌂\n        →\n        ↑\n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ During Tempest, fine members are working a lot and don’t have time to spend together, specially Eichi.

However, since it’s quite the mouthful and not that visually appealing,  it&#39;s usually referred to simply as “JNLC” (Japanese Neverland Cup)1\n\n...So many national events and institutions frequently use a “J” in their abbreviations; I feel like it can be confused with other things and could be hard to remember\n…You and I can understand them easily, but I think it can be hard for the common people…\n\nEh, so you’re aware that you’re different from the others “in general”, huh? As a person with some experience, I would like to advise you that this is a thorny path2\n\n…A thorny path?3\n…Fufu, as long as I live as a part of Eden and Adam, no matter how hard I try, my path will always be a thorny one devised by Ibara\n\nOh, a pun? Our Eichi is quite fond of those too. Since you two were in fine in the past, maybe you came to resemble him after working together?\n\n...Perhaps. Humans live their lives interacting and influencing each other, after all\n\nWell, and in your case, that’s quite extreme, huh?\nSince you were stuck in a pretty little box as a kid and didn’t interact at all with the world, you’re more prone to being influenced by others around you, I fear. After all, the purer the white clothes, the more dirt stains will stand out\n\n...Indeed. But well, I’ve already been completely stained the moment I met Ibara, so now it’s as pitch black as it can get♪\n\nSuch words of affection, but, due to your nature, I would say you’re better suited in white\n\n...On the other hand, I would say you’re better suited in black, the chaotic reunion of all colors\n\nFuFuFu. Perhaps we were matched with the wrong partners, then?\n\n...No, I disagree. If your life ends in the same way that it did when you were born, without interacting with anyone, without any changes, then what’s the value of this life?\n...Everyone adapts themselves for this environment or continues to change due to the stimuli they receive. By mixing and matching the “newest version of yourself”, we substantially preserve our lives\n...Even in a world that was abandoned by God, we can still live in such a way\n\nAmazing! Oh precious and good humored incarnation of Adam, the first of mankind. You’re truly the personification of the human trajectory that has been long told by the Bible!\nSing out loud in this key, as you claim that stupidity, that ugliness, and all the rest that makes humanity as indeed what gives meaning to “humanity”!\nDye the earth in blood while proclaiming “I’m the one who rules this land”!\n\n...Do you perhaps despise me and it&#39;s trying to condemn me as an attempt to hurt my feelings?\n...After all I...No, we acted in not very “fine” ways, so it&#39;s okay if you would like to take revenge on us\n\nNot at all. If I were to take revenge, it would insinuate I have a grudge against all of you, would it not?\n\n...And yet you should. In the present society mankind has built in this world, it&#39;s hard to survive unless you at least pretend to be “human”\n...Though I suppose saying that to you would be like preaching to the choir, Hibiki Wataru-kun of the “Five Eccentrics”\n\nOf course I’m aware of that, Ran Nagisa-san of the former fine\nYou were the ones who made me realize this, after all. And yet, when it comes to the pursuit of love and wonder, I&#39;m happy to continue playing the role of the clown\nYou know that all too well as an angel that created such an utopia by chopping us up into several parts and scattering our remains out there\n\n...Indeed I know, o foolish monster that read us as an open book, yet willingly laid himself down to serve as a foundation\n...The present era has been built atop your sacrifices. We are the only ones that will never forget about it\n\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\nAnyways, back to the subject at hand. If you don’t mind, would you like to participate in the “JNLC” with me?\n\n...Has anyone ever told you that your actions are quite sudden?\n\nTruthfully, I&#39;m rather bad at negotiation and solicitation, for I rarely ever ask others for something, so I’m inexperienced\n\n... I understand, so it’s fine\n...“JNLC”, huh. If I remember correctly, it was originally a western competition\n...The original Neverland Cup was an event with a huge history and prestige, the “Oscars” Academy Awards of the musical industry\n...The original idea was to award the most artistic musicians in the world. The “JNLC” would be the Japanese version of it, founded by my father\n\nYes indeed, the founder is none other than the Godfather, whose name has been brought up again recently\n\n...Well, my father was the founder of almost all systems and cultures in this modern industry of idols\n...Though the name “Godfather” sounds almost wrong for him. It makes him sound like the head of a mafia\n...My father was nothing but an idol. No, he was a father who loved and took care of all idols\n\nExactly, that’s why we call him “father”. Each of us is inevitably a descendant of that formidable monster\nHowever, we cannot continue to be prodigal children who only waste the inheritance left behind by our parents\nEspecially now that we have this home to call ours,Ensemble Square, it&#39;s pathetic for us to still be stuck to our umbilical cords\nThus, there has been action to reassess the “JNLC”, to promote it, and let it become a solid and reliable musical prize for the whole world\nOne of my old partners in the acting industry happens to be in charge of this project.\nThey asked me if I could help them, for the good old times\nBut well, there are some reasons that make fine not very ideal to take part in that, and I have to come to specialize in acting…\nI&#39;m sure I can join as a musician, but I&#39;m not too sure whether my performance can be deemed artistic\nThe “JNLC” is an event to determine who’s the most artistic musician of Japan. Even if I joined as myself, I would be out of place\nI could call the folks from “Träumerei”, but all of them seemed to be busy with their own matters\nAnd so, while thinking on what to do, I found you\n\n...Hm, but it seemed like I was your target from the very beginning\n...“JNLC”? There’s something beautiful in the idea of winning the trophy that my father left\n...I’ll check with Ibara for permission, but it&#39;s most likely that I&#39;ll be able to enter as well\n\nAmazing! Wonderful, so you shall enter with me as a duo\nThe former members of the Five Eccentrics and fine joining hands! Surely this will cause quite the uproar\n\n...Fufu. I hope this won’t reopen half-healed wounds of the past\n...However, if we’re talking about artistic musicians, I&#39;m sure you already have the perfect friend for it\n...Wouldn’t it be better if you had called him instead of me?\n\nFufufu. Recently “he” seems to have little to no interest in anything besides his own art, so even if I were to ask him, he would probably decline\nBesides, I’m not the person he should be pursuing art with…\nIn the first place, since always we walk completely opposite paths.
