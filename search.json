However, since it’s quite the mouthful and not that visually appealing,  it&#39;s usually referred to simply as “JNLC” (Japanese Neverland Cup)1\n\n...So many national events and institutions frequently use a “J” in their abbreviations; I feel like it can be confused with other things and could be hard to remember\n…You and I can understand them easily, but I think it can be hard for the common people…\n\nEh, so you’re aware that you’re different from the others “in general”, huh? As a person with some experience, I would like to advise you that this is a thorny path2\n\n…A thorny path?3\n…Fufu, as long as I live as a part of Eden and Adam, no matter how hard I try, my path will always be a thorny one devised by Ibara\n\nOh, a pun? Our Eichi is quite fond of those too. Since you two were in fine in the past, maybe you came to resemble him after working together?\n\n...Perhaps. Humans live their lives interacting and influencing each other, after all\n\nWell, and in your case, that’s quite extreme, huh?\nSince you were stuck in a pretty little box as a kid and didn’t interact at all with the world, you’re more prone to being influenced by others around you, I fear. After all, the purer the white clothes, the more dirt stains will stand out\n\n...Indeed. But well, I’ve already been completely stained the moment I met Ibara, so now it’s as pitch black as it can get♪\n\nSuch words of affection, but, due to your nature, I would say you’re better suited in white\n\n...On the other hand, I would say you’re better suited in black, the chaotic reunion of all colors\n\nFuFuFu. Perhaps we were matched with the wrong partners, then?\n\n...No, I disagree. If your life ends in the same way that it did when you were born, without interacting with anyone, without any changes, then what’s the value of this life?\n...Everyone adapts themselves for this environment or continues to change due to the stimuli they receive. By mixing and matching the “newest version of yourself”, we substantially preserve our lives\n...Even in a world that was abandoned by God, we can still live in such a way\n\nAmazing! Oh precious and good humored incarnation of Adam, the first of mankind. You’re truly the personification of the human trajectory that has been long told by the Bible!\nSing out loud in this key, as you claim that stupidity, that ugliness, and all the rest that makes humanity as indeed what gives meaning to “humanity”!\nDye the earth in blood while proclaiming “I’m the one who rules this land”!\n\n...Do you perhaps despise me and it&#39;s trying to condemn me as an attempt to hurt my feelings?\n...After all I...No, we acted in not very “fine” ways, so it&#39;s okay if you would like to take revenge on us\n\nNot at all. If I were to take revenge, it would insinuate I have a grudge against all of you, would it not?\n\n...And yet you should. In the present society mankind has built in this world, it&#39;s hard to survive unless you at least pretend to be “human”\n...Though I suppose saying that to you would be like preaching to the choir, Hibiki Wataru-kun of the “Five Eccentrics”\n\nOf course I’m aware of that, Ran Nagisa-san of the former fine\nYou were the ones who made me realize this, after all. And yet, when it comes to the pursuit of love and wonder, I&#39;m happy to continue playing the role of the clown\nYou know that all too well as an angel that created such an utopia by chopping us up into several parts and scattering our remains out there\n\n...Indeed I know, o foolish monster that read us as an open book, yet willingly laid himself down to serve as a foundation\n...The present era has been built atop your sacrifices. We are the only ones that will never forget about it\n\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\nAnyways, back to the subject at hand. If you don’t mind, would you like to participate in the “JNLC” with me?\n\n...Has anyone ever told you that your actions are quite sudden?\n\nTruthfully, I&#39;m rather bad at negotiation and solicitation, for I rarely ever ask others for something, so I’m inexperienced\n\n... I understand, so it’s fine\n...“JNLC”, huh. If I remember correctly, it was originally a western competition\n...The original Neverland Cup was an event with a huge history and prestige, the “Oscars” Academy Awards of the musical industry\n...The original idea was to award the most artistic musicians in the world. The “JNLC” would be the Japanese version of it, founded by my father\n\nYes indeed, the founder is none other than the Godfather, whose name has been brought up again recently\n\n...Well, my father was the founder of almost all systems and cultures in this modern industry of idols\n...Though the name “Godfather” sounds almost wrong for him. It makes him sound like the head of a mafia\n...My father was nothing but an idol. No, he was a father who loved and took care of all idols\n\nExactly, that’s why we call him “father”. Each of us is inevitably a descendant of that formidable monster\nHowever, we cannot continue to be prodigal children who only waste the inheritance left behind by our parents\nEspecially now that we have this home to call ours,Ensemble Square, it&#39;s pathetic for us to still be stuck to our umbilical cords\nThus, there has been action to reassess the “JNLC”, to promote it, and let it become a solid and reliable musical prize for the whole world\nOne of my old partners in the acting industry happens to be in charge of this project.\nThey asked me if I could help them, for the good old times\nBut well, there are some reasons that make fine not very ideal to take part in that, and I have to come to specialize in acting…\nI&#39;m sure I can join as a musician, but I&#39;m not too sure whether my performance can be deemed artistic\nThe “JNLC” is an event to determine who’s the most artistic musician of Japan. Even if I joined as myself, I would be out of place\nI could call the folks from “Träumerei”, but all of them seemed to be busy with their own matters\nAnd so, while thinking on what to do, I found you\n\n...Hm, but it seemed like I was your target from the very beginning\n...“JNLC”? There’s something beautiful in the idea of winning the trophy that my father left\n...I’ll check with Ibara for permission, but it&#39;s most likely that I&#39;ll be able to enter as well\n\nAmazing! Wonderful, so you shall enter with me as a duo\nThe former members of the Five Eccentrics and fine joining hands! Surely this will cause quite the uproar\n\n...Fufu. I hope this won’t reopen half-healed wounds of the past\n...However, if we’re talking about artistic musicians, I&#39;m sure you already have the perfect friend for it\n...Wouldn’t it be better if you had called him instead of me?\n\nFufufu. Recently “he” seems to have little to no interest in anything besides his own art, so even if I were to ask him, he would probably decline\nBesides, I’m not the person he should be pursuing art with…\nIn the first place, since always we walk completely opposite paths.

And enjoy a blissful time savoring this thing♪\n\n\n  Location:\n    Aira, Eichi and Rei Dorm\n  \n\n\nI’m home—\nUwaaaaah?! What the?!\nThere’s a coffin in the middle of my room!? What? What&#39;s happening? That’s super scary!\nEhhh... I was feeling so happy just a moment ago. Now I feel like I’ve encountered a bad omen outta nowhere…\n…Uhh, what should I do about this…?\nI looked around, but found nothing weird. No matter how you look at it, it&#39;s just a normal coffin\nWell, when you think about it, finding a coffin in the middle of your bedroom is already weird enough\nRight…! Nothing will change if I just keep staring at it. It&#39;s scary alright, but I’ll suck it up and take a peep insidee…\nMaybe is just someone trying to make a tasteless jo—\n\n\n…\n...?!?!?1\n\n\n  Time:\n    Some time later\n  \n\n\nI’m home\n\nUwaaaaaah… Sniffs… Hic\n\nEh? Shiratori-kun, why are you crying? What happened?\n\nUwaaah… Tenshouin-senpai… Guh… S-Sakuma-senpai… Sakuma-senpai… He diiieeeddd!\n\nBy saying Sakuma-senpai you mean Sakuma-kun? I’m sure there must be a misunderstanding\nI can imagine someone as weak as me dying, but you can&#39;t kill someone like Sakuma-kun even if you try to\n\nBut it’s true! I saw with my own eyes. He was lying down with a peaceful face inside that coffin… Sobs\n\n…Now that you mention it, this thing should be in Yumenosaki. Why is it in our room?\n\n\nHm?\nIt&#39;s been quite noisy here for a while. Could you please tone it down?\n\nKyaaaaah?! A zombie?! Please, Sakuma-senpai, let go of your resentment and transcend peacefully~!2\n\n\n  Time:\n    A few minutes later\n  \n\n\nHave you calmed down now, Shiratori-kun?\n\nYeah… I’d never imagine you’d be sleeping in a coffin… Sorry for making such a ruckus\n\nGood grief. It doesn’t come as a surprise that someone like Shiratori-kun would misunderstand the situation. I hope you finally understand that this habit of yours is neither normal nor acceptable, Sakuma-kun\n\nOh dear. I seem to have given you a hard time, Shiratori-kun. I sincerely apologize for causing you such a fright\n\nFirst of all, you’ve been properly sleeping in a bed since you came to the dorms. So why did you resort to your coffin again?\n\nTruth be told... I’ve been having trouble falling asleep as of late. Waking up in the morning has been quite the challenge, as well\n\nYou’ve been having trouble to sleep…?\n\nIndeed. I’ve been doing my utmost to resist sleeping in my coffin when we live in a shared environment, you see?\nIt’s not like I can bring it to work either, so I&#39;m trying to get used to sleeping in a bed every day\n\n\nNo matter where I go, it&#39;s always beds, beds, beds… When they tell you to rest, it’s always go to bed… This thing that brings comfort to people do nothing but stress me out~\nI want to feel that tender embrace again… That nostalgic feeling of being entombed… Sigh\n\nPoor Sakuma-Senpai…\n\nDon’t fall for such a thing, Shiratori-kun\nDon’t you feel guilty deceiving your young and naïve junior?\n\nEh. Why would you say that, Tenshouin-kun…?\n\nNo use pretending to be all cute and innocent. It doesn’t work on me in the slightest. In any case, of course you’d only see beds wherever you go\nBy the way, where did this coffin even come from? Last I saw it, I recall it being in the Light Music Club room at the academy\n\nThe staff at the agency noticed how exhausted I was, so they went to the lengths of bringing it here for me. They told me to at least have a short rest\n\nOh dear, so even the staff at the agency noticed…\nSigh… Alright, you already took your nap, right?\nThis dorm is a shared space, so please don’t keep troublesome things in it, okay? You must put this back to where it came from immediately\n\nHow blunt of you. Not even a shred of sympathy, huh?\n\nIf this coffin is still here the next time I come into this room, I&#39;ll get rid of it myself using whatever means it takes\n\nYou’re such a devil of man?!\n\n\n  Location:\n    Yumenosaki's Light Music Club\n  \n\n\n“—Therefore, the demonic Tenshouin-kun ordered me to bring the coffin back to the Light Music Club, which I have left alongside this letter.

Aira’s basically saying “rest in peace” in a Buddhist way, you can read about it here."},{"title":"Shoe Sores and Aching Muscles - Kohaku Idol Story","url":"//shoe_sores_and_aching_muscles/","content":"\n\n\n(My Own Distance) Kohaku Oukawa\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n            \n            \n                    \n            \n        \n    \n\nAlthough uncertain, Kohaku searches for the answer to how he wants to express his \"current” self.

Sorry fer makin’ ya wait, Anzu-han, hope ya can forgive me?\nI set out with plenty o’ time, but dang if I didn’t go an’ lose my way\nAin’t my first time comin’ to the Producer Room, yet it’s a funny thing. Guess I just assumed I’d get here no problem, an’ wound up headin’ clean the wrong way\nWhen I realized it, I was standin’ smack dab in the opposite direction. Let out a weird yelp without meanin’ to\nI figured, I managed fine in the city, I’ll be just fine here too… turns out that baseless confidence was just plain ol’ arrogance\n…Come to think of it, when we first met, Anzu-han, it was kinda the same\nI was lost at the station an’ you came up talkin’ to me. Ya remember?\nI remember it clear. Back then I didn’t have the faintest clue where ES was, just stood there frozen\nWhen it showed up after just walkin’ a bit, I was real shocked. Couldn’t believe I missed a buildin’ that huge. Felt pitiful\nBut well, it ain’t a bad memory. Since we was headin’ the same way, ya walked with me, even patched up my blisters\nThe city’s all glittery but cold somehow. Still, there’s good folks ‘round, that made me happy\n…Even today, if I’d called ya, ya would’ve come pick me up? Anzu-han, you really are kind\nBut I ain’t no kid no more, ya know. Compared to back then, I can get anywhere on my own feet\nI’m used to my shoes now, no more sore feet from walkin’ ‘round. Bein’ clueless ‘bout left or right, that’s all in the past\n…Well, gettin’ lost in the first place still ain’t exactly cool\nAt least ya didn’t see me openin’ the map app and wanderin’ in circles\nAnyhow, just makin’ it here on my own feels good. Ain’t much, but there’s a sense of achievement\nAnd if next time I come without messin’ up, then this weren’t a failure. It’s experience\nThis time I can brush it off as a “personal errand”, but if it was work, I couldn’t be so easygoin’\nI’ll make today’s wrong turn count next time. Don’t worry ‘bout me\nSo then, let’s get to the point, what’s this errand ‘bout?\n…Hmm, hmm. Heard rumors ‘bout that. Somethin’ that just started, right?\nAs part of Mega Stream, idols doin’ solo live streams…\nOh, makin’ a costume just for that stream, huh\nSo that means it’s a pretty serious project. Well, if all idols are included, I s’pose it’s natural\nSo? What ya want bringin’ that up with me?\n…Ya wanna hear my opinion? Someone new like me don’t know half as much as you, Anzu-han. Ain’t even worth askin’, is it?\nEhh… next is my turn…?\nWhe-what’s that ‘bout! This ain’t no “personal errand,” it’s proper work!\nI thought it’d be more like small talk, at most just casual chat, so I came here relaxed…\nTrue enough, like ya said, reckon a solo job could count as a “personal errand”...\nNah nah, normally it doesn&#39;t! But knowin’ you, Anzu-han, ya just said that so I wouldn’t get all tense\nI get it now. Ya wanna put my tastes and image into the costume, heh\n“The me I wanna show right now,”. Hmm…\n…Nothin’ comes to mind right off\nIf it’s clothes I wanna wear… I could pick casual wear easy enough\nBut it ain’t like I feel strongly, “I wanna wear this,” I just grab whatever on a whim\nAnd idol costumes are another thingy. Somethin’ that important, I get nervous thinkin’ if it’s really okay for me to decide\nI do kinda think it’d be good if it’s a costume fans love, one they’ll remember forever\nBut what you’re wantin’, Anzu-han, ain’t that sorta “right answer,” it’s my own feelings, ain’t it?\nIf ya ask how I wanna show myself now, honestly I got no idea\nBut still… since ya called me out like this, feels wasteful to say nothin’\nLike ya said, I could leave it up to ya, Anzu-han, but if I do nothin’, it’s the same as back then\nSame as that time I was just standin’ there, surrounded by huge buildings\n…I been lost plenty since becomin’ an idol, but I still remember every path I walked on my own feet\nThat’s why this time too… even if I wander ‘round, I’ll find the answer myself\nMega Sphere’s so wide it still feels like I done come to some foreign country\nMight sound dramatic talkin’ ‘bout how I’ll live here\nBut maybe it’ll be a good chance to think on how I’ll spend my days in this new place\n\nChapter 2\n\n  Location:\n    A hallway within the Mega Sphere Tower\n  \n\n\n(What kinda of self I wanna show, huh... bein’ asked with no clue like this, it’s not somethin’ you can answer easily)\n(Good thing I got some time to think. I gotta thank Anzu-han)\n(Hmm… For now, I’ll take another look at the outfits I’ve worn so far. Might give me some clues)\n(This one’s from when I did Crazy:B, and this one’s from Double Face…)\n(I hadn’t really noticed before, ‘cause I was always focused on the work at hand, but the vibe really changes with each unit)\n(But… what is it…? I’ve got good feelings for both, but maybe it’s better not to use the unit outfits as reference)\n(This time I’m standin’ not as a unit, but as Kohaku Oukawa himself)\n(…I think I understand that logic, at least in my own way)\n(Tryin’ not to think about the unit’s image is tough. That means my choices get a lot narrower)\n(Speakin’ of solo, I remember wearin’ my exclusive outfit that had a cherry blossom on the back)\n(It was beautiful, and I think it suited me pretty well too)\n(I’ve always been familiar with traditional clothes, but it doesn’t feel like what I want to show now)\n(Not just an extension of the past. What can I show as Kohaku Oukawa in this very moment? It’s tough…)\n(…Hm? Someone’s here)\n(Mutterin’ to myself here, but what are them doin’? Don’t look like them are lost though…)\n\n\nFound it! I’ve discovered the hidden exit leadin’ to a brand-new world☆\nAfter a hundred years of hardship! A huge adventure full of ups and downs has paid off! Congrats to me!\nWith this, I’ve gotten one step closer to the “Million Secrets” slumberin’ in Mega Sphere—where findin’ them all grants your wish!\nAdvancin’ straight toward uncoverin’ the truth! The adventurer Esu’s journey ain’t over yet…☆\nNow, what awaits ahead, I wonder~\n\n\n—That ain’t an exit, it’s a vent, y’know?\n\nAh! Hello, Kohaku-senpai. Thanks for your hard work\n\nThanks for bein’ polite. You’re Esu-han, right?\nWhat’ve ya been doin’ all this time? And what’s this “Million Secrets” thing anyway?\n\nGood question! My unit mates don’t really go along with it~\n”Million Secrets” is just somethin’ I made up. Mega Sphere’s huge, so it ain’t strange if there’s that many secrets, right?\n\nBut still, a million… realistically, ain’t a hundred enough?\n\nNo no. It’s “Mega”, so a million’s gotta be about right\n\nGeez. I just don’t get what kids do\nHow old are ya, anyway?\n\nMe? I’m sixteen\n\nNo way, really?\n\nIt’s true. Look, my ID~\n\n…It really is. Same age as me, huh\n\nEh!???? Seriously??????\nI always thought you were older! Crazy:B is a unit with a grown-up vibe, isn’t it!\nKohaku-senpai’s calm and presence… it’s totally that of a veteran\nBut if we’re the same age, callin’ ya senpai’s weird. Uh… Kohaku-kun?\nWhoa, feels kinda off…!\n\nKohkohkoh♪ I actually prefer it that way. Rarely anyone calls me senpai anyway\nWhen it comes to same age, only Rabu-han comes to mind, and I’m the youngest in the unit. Feels kinda close, y’know?\n\nI get that! The moment I realized we’re the same age, all the walls came down☆\nI’d be glad if we can get along from here! Pleased to meet yaaaaaa!\n\n…You’re mighty energetic. How do you have that much voice?\n\nThankss! Energy’s my only sellin’ point!\n\nThat’s respectable in its own way though…\n(I wonder… Esu-han feels so dazzling. Hard to believe we’re the same age)\n(…Even Rabu-han’s kinda cheerful. Esu-han feels more age-appropriate, I guess)\n(If I’d grown up somewhere else, livin’ a different life… would I have been more lively too…?)\n\nHm? Something wrong?\n\nAh, nuthin’\nIt’s just… lookin’ at you makes me feel like I’ve aged a bit\nFeels like I’ve been left behind a little\n\nLeft behind, huh… are we talkin’ about speed?\n\nSpeed?\n\nYeah. Like how you go through life, growin’… that kinda stuff!\nBut it’s all good! There ain’t no early or late for startin’ an adventure!\nStrike while the iron’s hot! Let’s go together!\n\nGo out? That’s a vent, ya know\n\nOpen sesameeeeeeee! Come on, let’s go to a brand new world☆\n\nHey, don’t pull my sleeve…!\nOi! Listen to what I’m sayin’!? \n\n\n  Location:\n    Mega Sphere Proucer Room\n  \n\n\n  Time:\n    The next day\n  \n\n\nAnzu-han, thanks for makin’ the time. About the outfit we talked ‘bout yesterday…\nEh? You mean my movements are stiff?\nYou really noticed that? Is it that obvious?\n\n\nDon’t worry, it’s just muscle soreness\nYesterday, we… walked all over Mega Sphere, me and Esu-han\nIn Esu-han’s words, that was an “adventure”\n\n\nWe didn’t go into vents, thankfully. But we walked forever up emergency stairs, back alleys, weird spots\nPlaces no one normally pays attention to\nMy legs are screamin’. I rarely ever get muscle pain though\n…Used muscles I normally don’t? Hm, makes sense\nIf ya think about it, it’s kinda like growth pains. Quietly hurtin’, but… not bad\nEsu-han looked like he wanted more, but for me, it was a huge adventure\nJust walkin’, but somehow it felt fresh and fun\nProbably because what Esu-han saw was totally different from me\nHard to say, but I felt something in Esu-han that I don’t have\n…Then it hit me. Maybe my life from now on is an adventure itself\nI can’t tell what I’ll be like in the future. Right now, I can’t even imagine\nSo now, I wanna absorb all sorts of things and grow\nSo I can move forward on my own two feet. So that when a big goal comes, I can hold my ground\nFor that reason… I wanna challenge myself with this outfit to show a version of me that could’ve existed\nBirth, upbringing, things I like… I’ll set all that aside for a bit\nI wanna wrap myself in the atmosphere of kids livin’ in the same era, even a little\n…Surely that’s somethin’ only possible “now”\nIt’s fine to be unsure. Even if it doesn’t suit me, that’s fine too. I wanna go all in, just as I am\nGatherin’ what I lack like that, buildin’ experience little by little…\nI feel like that way, I could live more like “Kohaku Oukawa”, holdin’ my chest high…♪\n\nCheck Other Idol Stories!\n\n  \n    \n        \n    \n      \n        Shoe Sores and Aching Muscles\n        \n      \n  \n  \n    \n        \n    \n      \n        One Single Person\n        \n      \n  \n\n\n        ⌂\n        ↑\n\n"},{"title":"Metamorphose - Eclsion","url":"//metamorphose/eclosion/","content":"\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    Characters\n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Writer\n                \n                \n                    Happy Elements K.K.\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Translation\n                \n                \n                    lukas\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                   Proofreading\n                \n                \n                Not Proofread\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n  Season: Summer\n\nChapter 1\n\n   The time goes back a few days. One day in late June\n\n\n\nToday’s a long-awaited Eichi Day!1\nIt’s super rare for all four of us in fine to have the day off together~♪\n\nWataru\nI don’t know if it was “KIRAKIRA” or “TEKATEKA,” but it sounds like you had a wonderful time in that unique unit. I heard you looked happier than you ever do in fine♪\n\n\nFufufu! Could it be jealousy, Eichi?\nYou’re the one who left the birdcage open. If you dislike me perching on other trees so much, perhaps you should have joined the Audition yourself?\n\n...Wait, why’s it getting so tense!?\nHey Yuzuru~! Do something about this atmosphere!\n\n\nEven if you say that to me...\nEichi-sama, Hibiki-sama. I don’t know what has transpired between you two, but please don’t make young master feel uncomfortable\n\nOh. My apologies, Tori, Yuzuru\nI trusted Wataru and sent him off, but it seems I’m not handling the idea of this NiceP producing him as well as I thought\n\nOh my. That’s quite the bitter face you’re making, Eichi~ Today feels like the day spears might fall from the sky!\n\nSpears aren’t gonna fall! You’re so dramatic\n\nOh? If you ask it of me, Hibiki Wataru can even make spears rain from above\nAnd! Thanks to the guidance of that Nice fellow, I can now deliver an even more polished, splendid show!\n\nI didn’t say you should actually do it!?\nWait, can NiceP’s coaching really change someone that much in just a few days?\nWell, he is a world-class producer, so maybe that much is to be expected\nI saw the “PIKAPIKA” video the other day. Hibiki-senpai, you were so amazing it made me a little jealous\nThe Nice Dream Units chosen in 4piece, every one of them was incredible\nIt really is a massive Audition program. I hate to admit it, but you can feel NiceP’s strength as a producer\nI feel like I got to see a new side of Hibiki-senpai I didn’t know before\n\nFufu. Entering in honor of the princess’s will, I was terribly nervous. Did I manage to save a bit of face?\n\nLiar~ You totally weren’t nervous! You were acting all carefree the whole time!\nIt was only at the very end that you finally got serious\n\nI was only wearing a mask. I may not look it, but I’m delicate, you know☆\n\nSetting Wataru’s nonsense aside, we’ve learned that fine still has much room to grow\nIn that sense, I’m grateful to 4piece. It let me witness Wataru’s evolution\nIf I could be greedy, I would’ve preferred to see that evolution within fine\n\nYour words are dripping with poison, Eichi-sama\n\nI didn’t mean it that way—or did I?\nLook at that. The trending Nice Dream Unit video is playing all over the front page\n\nYou’re right! Hibiki-senpai is singing and dancing!\n\nFufu. I never thought 4piece would draw this much attention\n\n“Attention, viewers of this broadcast! Pardon the interruption!”\n\n\nNngyo!?\nWhat is that? A video hijack…!?\n\nIt appears so. They’ve swapped in some sort of Nice Dream Unit promotional video from somewhere\n\n\n“Thanks to idols, staff, and of course you viewers, 4piece ended in great success, and I am truly grateful”\n“At the same time, here in this country, I plan to launch a new joint project between Thunderbolt and ES”\n“The announcement is scheduled three days from now, at 15:00 JST! Please look forward to it!”\n\n\nWhat the heck… A new Thunderbolt and ES joint project…?\n\nEichi-sama, have you heard anything of this?\n\nNo. Thunderbolt and ES have a comprehensive contract. Within its terms, NiceP is granted discretion\nThat includes announcing and carrying out projects\nWe have no right to control his every move, nor does he need our permission each time\n\nEh? So NiceP can just do whatever he wants at ES for now?\n\nOf course, we’re being compensated appropriately\nAnd naturally, I didn’t agree to anything outrageous\nAs ES office heads, we retain the authority to keep our idols from participating in Thunderbolt’s projects\nIf NiceP ever acts against my ideals, against what suits ES, I won’t remain silent\n\nStill, NiceP sure loves to pull annoying surprise announcements\nJust because he’s from some huge overseas company, he thinks he can look down on us. Eichi-sama’s the one who’s built up ES till now, isn’t he?\n(But)\n(If NiceP is starting another project, that means I might have a chance too)\n(A project that made Hibiki-senpai grow, a project even Eichi-sama envied—I could be part of it)\n(I missed out when I withdrew back then)\n(But if I get another chance—)\n\n—Young master?\n\nAh, no! it’s nothing!\nI just thought maybe that troublemaking producer is scheming up something flashy again?\nAnyway, let’s go! It’d be a waste not to enjoy our precious day off, right?\n\nIndeed. Let’s end the work talk here and savor this valuable holiday\nAfter enduring the fierce Audition battles and wrapping up “PIKAPIKA” activities, now is the perfect time to stretch our wings\nSoon enough, there will likely be new developments. For now, let the four of us here enjoy a peaceful, ordinary day together...☆\n\nChapter 2\n\n   At the same time, at the Cafe Cinnamon in the ES Bulding\n\n\n\n(A new project to replace “4piece”, sure smells fishy to me)\n(I hear Mr. Nice Arneb Thunder2, better known as “NiceP”─became a man of the hour starting with “4piece”, thanks to his earnest and gentlemanly conduct)\n(Even if he moved his base overseas after retiring as an idol, it’s strange how domestic media ignored him for so long)\n(It must have been the media pandering to this country’s idol industry. NiceP was on the verge of being forgotten at home)\n(I only ever heard rumors while traveling overseas myself...)\n(If I remember correctly, nowadays a unit called “Mellow Dear Us” is popular in his place?)\n(A former super idol and now a world-class producer. He’s been active on all fronts, like the protagonist of a story)\n(Am I just being twisted for finding something fishy in such a smooth-sailing path?)\n(It began with reforming the “P-Association,” then bringing in Anzu-san, who’s highly trusted by idols, to hold the 4piece program. As a result, they’ve even infiltrated the depths of ES)\n(Even if the other side has immense capital, Eichi-san and Ibara-san’s eyes can’t be so blind as to accept their invasion head-on)\n(The ES executives understand the current situation and are letting it be)\n(No, perhaps it’s better to say they can’t intervene)\n(The people of this country have always admired foreign goods, but if uncritical praise goes too far, it becomes poison)\n(I don’t know what Eichi-san and the others are doing behind the scenes. But maybe I should make some moves myself?)\n(For example, what if I got in touch with someone who knew NiceP during his idol days?)\n(Normally, they’d be around here一)\n\n\nSorry to keep you waiting~♪\nI brought freshly baked pizza, so let’s eat it while it’s hot~♪\n\n\nRinne-han...... do ya even know what ya did?\n\n一An unbelievable blunder. It wouldn’t be strange if you were forced to take responsibility?\n\n\nSorry! It was my bad! Just spare me the violence, seriously!\n\nEhh, eh. What’s going on!?\nRinne-kun being at fault is nothing new, but Cinnamon is a proper café, so don’t bring dangerous stuff up here!\n\n\nIt ain’t “as always.” But yeah, this time really was my mistake\n\n?That’s rare? For Rinne-kun to apologize honestly\n\nNaturally. Amagi didn’t even consider participating in 4piece\nI heard from the deputy director. Cos Pro was preparing to take on the audition as an agency―\nYet only Valkyrie and Crazy:B didn’t even send a reply\n\nMe and HiMERU-han couldn’ go either way, we had work\nStill, ES and Thunderbolt joined hands to create a huge project, we could’ve at least mentioned it, don’t you think\n\nNot conforming to the big current is Crazy:B’s virtue. But Amagi himself wouldn’t want to be left behind\n\nOhh. That’s nice of ya, Merumeru♪ You praising Crazy:B to my face, huh\n\nDon’t joke around. Why didn’t Amagi mention “4piece”\n\nThere ain’t any hidden reason. This time it was just my poor judgment\nYou and Kohaku-chan seemed busy with PBB4, would you be interested in the Audition anyway?\nI never planned on joining, and Niki’s juggling being a cook and idol. For us right now, it just didn’t seem that important\n\n\nThat’s a lie, the truth is, you’ve got some history with NiceP, don’t you?\n\nWhoae!? Since when were you there!?\nJumping in from the side like that’s bad for my heart! At least say something if you’re there!\n\nI was patiently watching! You all seemed to be having such an intense conversation, so I was observing♪\n\nPretty twisted of ya. Watching my disgrace on purpose like that\nSo? What is it, you want something with Kohaku-chan or what?\nKohaku-chan belongs to us, Crazy:B, ya know? If you want him back, you better show some proper sincerity?\n\nEh? who said I “belonged” to Crazy:B? This ain’ Hana Ichimonme3\n\nHahaha! You’re clearly trying to change the subject? Looks like you’ve got something on your mind, Rinne-san\nFrom here on, I’ll be asking, no, interrogating you\nAnd I want everyone here to act as witnesses\n\nWhat’s with ya, Madara-han, making it sound so grand… Are ya saying Rinne-han did anything?\n\nOh, nothing serious. Nothing against the law, nothing against reason\nA story the world has forgotten. I came to dig it up\nRinne-san. Back in your idol days, ya were in the same agency and debuted together as peers with NiceP, aka Yoshihide Sanda, weren’t you?\nCan you tell me about that time in detail?\n\nWith NiceP, in the same agency…?\n\nWait, seriously, Rinne-kun!?\nIf I remember, Rinne-kun, you worked as a solo idol for a while, but you never really told me much about that, right?\nCould it be you actually knew some huge name?\n\nNow that it’s mentioned, you’re the same age. The timing and age fit, but to think you were that close...\nCould that really be the reason you didn’t tell us about 4piece?\n\nNo it ain’t. Niki never cared about the industry from the start, and 4piece just happened\n...Tch, wonder where you sniffed that out from\nFinee. Wasn’t hiding it anyway. I’ll tell ya as much as ya want\nThough it’s just some worthless tall tale, nothing worth digging up\n\nChapter 3\n\nYoshihide Sanda was a solo idol who debuted at the same time as me\nBack then, I was just some punk who didn’t know jack about how the industry worked, running around the bottom rung with my first producer, AkanP\nIn contrast to the likes of us, Yoshihide-kun was on a winning streak from the moment he debuted\n\n\n“Yoshihide-kun”? Sounds like you two were pretty close, heh?\n\nHe’s the one who came up to me saying, “Call me by my name,” that’s all\nFrom his point of view, I was just a no-name rookie idol not even worth remembering. He probably doesn’t even remember me now\nNot long after we both debuted, our group of newcomers got to stand on the same stage, kind of like a showcase for rookies\nEven among all the others, Yoshihide-kun’s talent stood out\nHe must’ve known and loved idols way before I ever did\nThinking back now, the Western-style songs he used to do, and the lyrics that could rival any singer-songwriter...\nThat must’ve been the first glimpse of his talent as a producer, huh?\nWith something as a born talent and personality, plus a heapin’ dose of passion and love, ya naturally reel in luck and fortune—\nAs long as ya keep clear o’ scandals after that, boom, you’re a top idol just like that\nBack in school, Yoshihide-kun was the popular fella of our year, but now he’s graduated and turned into NiceP\nA prodigy who climbed straight up to the top of the idol world in record time, that’s what he was\n\nFor Rinne-han to go praisin’ him like that… he really must’ve been somethin’, that NiceP fella\nSo then. That answer good enough for ya, Madara-han?\nI dunno all the details, but… ya kicked up a fuss, so ain’t it only proper to at least offer an apology?\n\n\nTrue enough. Seems I went and made things more complicated than they had to be\nMy bad. From what I’ve heard now, there don’t seem to be many ties between him and Rinne-san. Thanks for answerin’ honestly\nThat leaves us with nothin’ to go on, huhh?\nI figured if I understood what kinda man NiceP was, his intentions’d be easier to see\n\nSo, Mike-nekochan, ya think NiceP’s scheming somethin’?\n\nWell, can’t hurt to stay on guard, that’s all\nRight now, he’s struttin’ into ES carryin’ the “Thunderbolt” brand name\nIf he’s as good a man as they say, I got no complaints\nBut since ES has a history of lettin’ in an underworld figure called Gatekeeper, I can’t just welcome NiceP without caution\n\nAhh… right, there was that time Anzu-chan got confined. Though from what I heard, it was more like she got treated real well ‘n looked after\nI get yer worries, Mike-nekochan, but when it comes to Yoshihide-kun, I don’t think there’s any need\nHe was a superhuman who shrugged off every scandal, that’s why he held his place as a superstar idol\nThe funny thing is, there’re a few like that out there, purebred saintly types ya can show the whole world without shame\n\nBeen botherin’ me fer a while now, what’s with callin’ him “Mike-nekochan”? He ain’t near as cute as one o’ them critters\n\nThe lack of cuteness is somethin’ y’all share, Kohaku-san, meow?\n\nDon’t talk nonsense. And quit tackin’ on them fool tails to yer words\n\nNahaha, you two’re in perfect sync~ ♪ Like a couple o’ cats play-fightin\n\nHah? Who ya callin’ a cat?\n\nNahaha… j-just kiddin’, just kiddin’!\nStill though, didn’t know you and NiceP had that kinda history, Rinne-kun~?\nCould it be that the reason you’re all jaded now’s ‘cause of NiceP?\nBack then you were way more pure, right? Having an idol like him so close by, must’ve stirred somethin’ in ya, huh?\n\nHmmm? So Rinne-han had a time like that, did he?\n\nBack then I was just a dumb kid who didn’t know nothin’\nI thought being a proper, orthodox idol was “normal”… I didn’t know any better, so I just did it without question\nDidn’t matter whether Yoshihide-kun was there or not\nI just hit a wall and started lookin’ at myself. Thanks to me, AkanP had to quit the industry, and by the time I looked back, it was already too late\nThat’s it! That’s all I got to say!\nPizza’s gettin’ cold, so why don’t ya head on home already?\n\nHiMERU agrees\nNo point in pressing Amagi further, nothing else’ll come out. Shall we look for someone else who knows NiceP’s past?\n\nHGood idea. Let’s check in with some folks from back then\nMe, I actually find folks who believe themselves pure and righteous without doubt the scariest of all\n\nYer one twisted fella, Madara-han\n\nGyahaha♪ I get whatcha mean, Mike-nekochan♪\nIf I didn’t know Yoshihide-kun myself, I’d be suspicious on NiceP as well\nSo I got a lil’ proposal\n\nHm?\n\nInstead of beating around the bush, why not just ask NiceP directly?\nIf it’s out in the open, he can’t just pull somethin’ shady even if he was a bad guy. Won’t turn out too bad that way\n\nHmmm… since you’re an old acquaintance, Rinne-san, it wouldn’t be strange for you to reach out\nAlright then, let’s have you make the excuse to slip into NiceP’s good graces\n\n…Hold up. Looks like that ain’t necessary\nJust now, while we were talkin’, a message came in from NiceP\n\nI got contacted at the exact same time\nWhat about the rest of ya? Get any messages?\n\nNope, not me\n\nHiMERU didn’t get one either\n\nThem too, huh. …So that means NiceP only reached out to Rinne-han an’ Madara-han\n\nNow it’s getting real interesting. This godlike timin’ ain’t somethin’ ya see even once in a million\nI knew he had miracle-level luck back then, but c’mon, what is he, psychic or somethin’? ♪\n\n\n“To you who will bear the new era of idols”\n“Come to the appointed place at the set time. There’s something important to discuss,” it says…\nWhat do you think, Rinne-san? Shall we take the bait?\n\n\nYeah. He went outta his way to call us, saves us the trouble\nWhen the mail says, “To my dear old friend Rinne-kun”… no way I could just ignore it\nThere’s plenty for me and Yoshihide-kun to catch up on. So how about we treat this like a lil’ class reunion… ☆\n\nChapter 4\n\n   Three days later\n\n\n\nUgh~. I can’t find a single clue…!\nI mean, where did NiceP even go? While I was running around searching all over ES, before I knew it, the day of the project announcement had already come!\nI wanted to directly negotiate to appear in NiceP’s new project. This is such a waste of time!\nIf only there was someone who seemed to know about NiceP’s whereabouts. Kunugi-sensei and Sagami-sensei were useless, and Anzu’s nowhere to be found either…\n\n\n...\n\nHmm? That’s…\n(That’s one of the new faces who appeared in 4piece, right?)\n(If I remember right, he was the prodigy boy who joined the Audition after being scouted by NiceP…?)\n(I don’t remember his name, but after the Audition he joined the unit Esupuri, and NiceP was producing him too…)\n(…This is it! A lead on NiceP!)\n(Wow, I’m so smart~! The real genius isn’t this kid, it’s Tori-sama!)\nYou there! Stop right now!\n\n…(Ignores and keeps walking)\n\nHey, don’t ignore me!\nHey kid! I’m talking to you, so at least answer me!?\n\n\n...\nDo you need something from me?\n\nYeah, I was calling you!\nYou’re that rookie from Esupuri, right? The genius boy!\n\nYes. I’m Kanna from “Esupuri.” I just recently joined NewDi as a rookie\n\nKanna, huh… Hmm, I’ll praise you at least for properly introducing yourself\nBut ignoring your senior’s voice isn’t good, right? There was no one else around, didn’t you think it might be you being called?\n\nNo. You seemed like trouble, so I pretended not to hear and was planning to go in my way\n\n~~~~~~!\n\nYou did that on purpose!? That makes it even worse, and so annoying~!\n\n...\nSigh…\nWhatever it is, just tell me what you need\nI’m not free either. This conversation just cost me fifty seconds of my life I’ll never get back\n\nWh-what is with this guy… he’s such a pain…!\nFine then… I’ll get straight to the point. Do you know where NiceP is?\nI’ve been looking for NiceP this whole time. If you have any idea, I want you to tell me\n\nI don’t. (Starts walking toward the exit)\n\nHey, wait~!? Don’t just leave!\nGeez, this is why rookies are hopeless. No manners at all!\nIn the entertainment world, hierarchy is absolute! Even if people call you a genius boy, if you get cocky you’ll be cast aside in no time, got it?\nYou have to properly listen to your seniors. Understand?\n\nI’m sorry\nI was already told by seniors at the office, “You can just ignore what Tori-kun says”\nThey said, “He immediately tries to act superior the moment he opens his mouth.” So I was following that advice\n\nThat’s Tsukasa’s doing, isn’t it!? What a jerk, spreading bad rumors to juniors beforehand… Who’s the one acting superior first, huh!?\nYou need to properly figure out which seniors you can actually trust. Tsukasa likes to act all senior-like, but you can’t believe anything he says!\n\nDidn’t you just say, “In the entertainment world, hierarchy is absolute”?\n\nYou’ve always got a comeback, huh~! How annoying can you get!?\nAnyway! You must not believe anything Tsukasa says!\nIf you’re going to treat anyone as a senior, it should be me! Me, Himemiya Tori, the student council president of Yumenosaki Academy!\n\nI see. Understood.\nIn that case, I’ll also forget the prior information that said, “Himemiya-san is the tyrannical and cruel king who rules over Yumenosaki Academy”\n\nThat’s a lie too! Seriously, what is Tsukasa filling your head with!?\n…Wait, this isn’t the time for that. I need to find NiceP\nYou really don’t know where NiceP is? He’s producing you, right?\n\nNo. I also haven’t been in contact with Nice-san for several days\nHe seemed busy with the newly announced project the other day. We’ve been doing lessons as a unit for a while\n\nI see~ So that means there’s no lead after all\nI thought that since he directly produces Esupuri, you’d know more about the new project. Guess I was wrong\n…Right. Ignoring-Glasses\n\nDo you still need something?\n\nUse that brain of yours and try to guess where NiceP is! Since they call you a genius, you should be good at this, right?\n\n...\n\nWhat’s with that pause…? Your attitude makes you seem annoyed\n\nYes. That’s exactly right\nIt’s troublesome, but it can’t be helped. I was just taught to “obey what seniors say,” so I’ll share only minor clues\nNice-san has hidden hints in Esupuri’s work documents before\nHe’s a born entertainer, so he might do that naturally\nSo, it’s safe to assume that hints were also hidden in the video the other day\nHis suggestive behavior and the deliberate choice to announce it three days later were part of encouraging that too\n\nHuh. So that’s NiceP’s personality? Now that I hear it, he reminds me a bit of Hibiki-senpai\nSo… what exactly is that hint?\n\nThat’s enough. Figure it out yourself\n\nYou’re leaving after saying that!?\nCome on! You’ve told me this much already. Don’t tease me, just tell me!\n\n…Please let me go already\nYou’ll understand if you watch the video―\nNice-san’s footage was shot from above\n\nFrom above…? You mean… up in the sky…?\n\nChapter 5\n\n   At the same time\n\n\n\nWas it really okay to ignore an email from someone like that Nice fellow?\nI thought you might share some common ground with his lofty ideals\n\n\nHmph. So the moment I show myself, this is what happens? Was this “Nice Produce” production really that impressive?\nYou’re completely mistaken if you thought I’d be persuaded, Wataru\nDid you really think I would cooperate with NiceP’s new project?\nNon. If you thought so, that’s extremely naive!\nI take pride in creating art that is truly one-of-a-kind. I went to Paris alone and grew up as an artist\nBut you know I’m not the type to watch a patron’s mood, don’t you?\nWhat I dislike most is being made to create something according to someone else’s wishes\nEven knowing that, I can’t understand why you recommended me. There must be plenty of suitable candidates elsewhere\n\nExactly, because you’re my closest friend♪\n\nWhat is this… using “closest friend” at a time like this… are you plotting something?\n\nNot quite. I mean it sincerely\nYou are one of the few friends I can truly connect with\nThat Nice fellow chose me as the top successful candidate in “4piece”. That’s why I wanted to recommend you and Rei for the next project\nThere are idols in ES even more talented than me. They’re the kind of people who make the idol industry interesting… so to speak♪\n\nHmph. Don’t drag other people into this on your own\nThere must be plenty of idols who want to work with NiceP, right? If you invite them, they’ll probably accept it with a smile\nI have a personal and noble mission to fulfill my own art\nUsing NiceP myself is one thing, but I have no intention of being used\n\nHehe. You’re the same as always, Shu\nI just wanted to see you working on something together with Rei\nWell, forcing it would just be a tragedy for both of us anyway\nThe other candidates are also talented enough. Let’s have them do their best on your behalf, Shu\n\nOthers? Are you gathering people besides Rei as well?\n\nYes. Including Rei and you, I’ve reached out to four skilled individuals\nIt seems that Nice fellow wants them to call themselves the “Four Kings of the Sky”…\n\nHow materialistic… Ignoring it was definitely the right choice\nGrouping skilled individuals together and making them take a name… it seems like a revival of the “Five Eccentrics”\nBeing turned into a single collective called the Five Eccentrics made us lose our strength\nEach of our individual merits was tarnished, our respect and consideration taken away, and we were elevated as villains to be defeated\nWhere is the guarantee that NiceP, like Tenshouin, won’t trample over us ES idols?\n\nThat… hehe. There isn’t any guarantee at all!\nBut there’s no guarantee that people won’t change. Shu, you know that much yourself\n\nWataru, you’re as you always are. You keep dancing along, performing according to someone else’s script to meet their expectations\nI don’t mean to deny you, but as a long-time friend, I’ll say this\nI don’t know what kind of person NiceP is, but choose carefully the friends you associate with\nJust like Tenshouin, NiceP might also be expecting “that” from you\n\nI see… Thank you for your advice\nBut Eichi and I aren’t exactly “best friends,” you know\nEver since being chosen for one of the “Nice Dream Units” people keep saying, “Is NiceP’s production really that good?”\nIt’s like a clumsy little comedy, really\n\nHmph. Is this supposed to be a lovers’ quarrel? I have no interest in listening to such nonsense\nThat’s enough. I’m busy with my creative work\n\nOh, my apologies. Seems like that wasn’t to your liking?\nThen, I’ll decline on your behalf to that Nice fellow\nLet’s meet again, my friend… ♪\n\nAh. We just worked together as the “Five Eccentrics” before, and it’s still too early for a reunion\n…Hm? That’s noisy. Seems like your smartphone is ringing\n\nOh? A call from Princess? That’s unusual…\n\n“Hello? Hibiki-senpai?”\n“Hibiki-senpai, you know a lot about the sky, right? You ride hot air balloons and stuff?”\n\n…Uh? Not that much, but is something the matter?\n\n“Actually, I’m looking for NiceP right now!”\n“NiceP said there would be an announcement for the new project, right?”\n“I’ll rush to the site and negotiate directly with NiceP! I’ll tell him, “Include me in the new project!”\n\n…\n\n“Ah, don’t tell Eichi-sama yet, okay? He doesn’t seem to like NiceP that much, so I’ll just observe for now!”\n\nI see, so that’s the situation\nIn that case, why don’t you try going to the airport?\n\n\nThe airport?\n\n“Yes. Nice fellow isn’t going to stay up in the sky for three full days, right?”\n“Actually, I’ve been helping with the new project consultations. It seems he often comes and goes through airports near ES”\n\nEh? You know about NiceP?\n\n“Yes. Though I don’t know the full details of the project”\n“He seems to be looking for the “Four Kings of the Sky”, four idols. Right now, there might just be a slot open”\n“This time, I recommended skilled individuals who didn’t participate in 4piece”\n\nWait a minute! Then why didn’t you recommend me?\nI’m part of fine too, you know? Speaking of fine, it’s one of the strongest units, part of the Big Three!\nFufu. I thought you, Princess, wouldn’t do anything to upset Eichi yourself\n\n“However, you, Princess, are steadily distancing yourself from Eichi, ignoring my concerns. I misjudged your growth♪”\n“You now may be the idol fit for this new era”\n“…There’s no time to be chatting like this, though”\n“It’s almost the time that that Nice fellow has designated. If you head to the airport now, you should make it in time”\n\nThank you, Hibiki-senpai! I’ll head to the nearby airport and try to find NiceP!\n\n\nWhat was that call just now? It sounded pretty chaotic—\n\nHehe. It seems they’ve been found. The new “Four Kings of the Sky”\nGiving them the answer might be “too much,” perhaps. But this is also my way of thanking them for letting me participate in the fun event called 4piece\nI wish you luck, Princess\nYou yourself are worthy of being a pioneer of this new era…♪\n\n\n        ⌂\n        ←\n        ⌂\n        →\n        ↑\n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ During Tempest, fine members are working a lot and don’t have time to spend together, specially Eichi.

I only meant to take a quick look, but I ended up stayin’ longer than expected\nEven so… The convenience store here in Mega Sphere may look ordinary, but it’s actually pretty impressive\nIn contrast to the unique passage area, at first glance it looks no different from a regular chain store on the surface…\nBut the selection is hugee, and they even have foreign snacks I’ve never seen before. Thanks to that, it was a nice little change of pace\nI’m hoomeee☆\n…Oops, I went and said it out loud even though nobody’s here. Guess that’s a leftover habit from living in the dorms\nHmm? That’s strange, I feel like there’s someone here…\n…Ohh?\n\n\nZzz… Zzz…\n\nWhy is Mika-san here? Did he mistake this for his room?\n…Nope. With all my stuff lying around, it must be Mika-san who got the wrong room\nMmm, he’s fast asleep. I hate to have to wake up him, but I can’t just leave him like this either\nAlright then, Mama will wake him gently♪\nMika-san, wake uppp☆\n\n\n…Nnh, nn…?\nOshi-san, don’t wake me up yet…\n\nOops, he’s half-asleep. Fufu, like a baby, it’s so cutee\nBut I’m not your Oshi-san, I’m your mamaaa1\n\nNna…? Mama…?\nFuaaah, uu…… Oh, ’s just Mikejima-senpai\nWhy’re ya here? Do ya need somethin’ with Valkyrie…?\n\nHahaha, that’s what I should be saying, isn’ it? This is my room, after all\n\nEhh……?\n...Nn—ahhh!? I-I’m soooo sorry! I barged in without permission an’ then fell asleep...!\nI really am sorry! I didn’ mean anything bad by it, please forgive me~!\n\nHahaha. No need to panic so much. I’m not mad or anything, y’know\n\nReal...? Ya’ll forgive me?\n\nYeahh. I’m also at fault for not locking up, since I was just goin’ out for a bit\nBut why’d ya come to my room? Wouldn’t it be better for you to sleep in Valkyrie’s room?\n\nThat’s... ’m not too sure myself.\nIf I had to say, maybe ’s ‘cause the rooms are built the same?\nIf I’d looked properly, I’d see the stuff inside was totally different, an’ realize right away it wasn’t my room…\nBut the layout’s exactly the same. I must’ve walked in without thinkin’ an’ mistaken it fer mine\n\nI see. Since I’m in a solo unit, they let me use this double room all by myself…\nIf the setup’s the same as your room, then it’s no wonder you got mixed up\n\nYeahh… Can’t believe I let my guard down that much\nI’ve been lackin’ sleep fer a while now. That’s probably why. I real gotta be more careful…\n\nLack of sleep?\n\nYeahh. Lately I’ve been on a roll as an artist\nMaybe ’s ‘cause the environment changed, but makin’ art’s been so fun. I forget to eat or sleep an’ just get absorbed in it\n“Just a little more”. I keep puttin’ everything else off. Once I start, I can’t stop, an’ before I know it the night’s already over\n\nI see. For you, art’s clearly more than just a hobby\nBut let me say this. Having something you’re passionate about is wonderful, but cuttin’ into your sleep isn’t a good thing\nA bit of sleep deprivation’s fine for a day or two, but when it piles up, it really wears you down\nThe fatigue you’ve built up w suddenly all hit you at once someday. The body doesn’t lie, y’know\n\nYeah... I know. That’s why I ended up crashin’ in yer room, Mikejima-senpai\nBut when I’m at my limit from lack of sleep, that’s exactly when the best ideas come to me\n’m st inexperienced. Feels like if I don’t pour my very life into it, I won’t be able to create anything worthwhile…\n\nMika-san, that’s not right\nIt’s not because you’re inexperienced that you should burn yourself out. When you’re inexperienced, that’s when you should take care of yourself and move forward little by little\nI won’t deny that art born from burning yourself out exists. But people who can keep creating that way? They’re few and far between\nEven Shu-san, the one you admire, surely takes proper time to rest\nWhat matters is being able to keep going. Isn’t the important thing how long you can keep bein’ an artist?\nI want you to take your time, Mika-san. Value yourself and keep goin’ steadily forward.\n\nMikejima-senpai…\nThankss. Dunno why, but yer words just really sank in\nWords from someone who’s traveled the world really hit different\n\nHehe, it’s easy enough to say with words\nAnyway, when you’re makin’ art in your room, it’s hard to relax when it’s time to rest, right?\nIf you’d like, feel free to use my room. It’s big, and people from other units sometimes stay over here too\n\nNo way, I couldn’t… That’d be way too much to ask\n\nNo need to hold back. We help each other out when we’re in trouble, don’t we?\nBesides, it feels a bit too luxurious havin’ this whole room to myself\nSo if someone else makes use of it, I’m grateful too\n\n…I see.

On the main street, outside of the Grand Hall where SS took place.\n\n\n\n(Sighhhhhhhh, what ‘m gonna doooo-)\n(Oshi-san’ll be mad atme~ No, instead of gettin’ mad atme, lately Oshi-san’s been so sweet with me that &#39;s givin’ me the chills, but he&#39;s still gonna scold me~)\n(He’ll abandon me~ I can just imagine Oshi-san’s face lookin’ atme with scorn~)\n\n\n.....♪\n(Wait a sec, why am I smilin’?! I need t’ think of somethin’, no matter what it is!)\n(Oshi-san’s returnin’ t’ Japan at noon, so I wanna make a solid plan before he gets here!)\n(I can hear him already~ “What have you even been doing until now? If you’ve been acting like nothing but a lifeless corpse, then I suppose I should have held a funeral for you.”)\n(I suppose that type of sarcasm is just right fer someone who’s well-bred…)\n.....♪\n(Nnha, this ain’t the time t’ get excited! I gotta think about what I need t’ think!)\n(Nnaaaa, God, why didn’t ya put a smarter brain in my head?!)\n(Aah… As I thought, it’s impossible to create my own art~)\n(If I try to imitate Oshi-san, I’d be nothin’ but a cheap façade.)\n\n“Amazing! For all the people on my left and on my right, and for every beautiful being that walks like migratory birds, If you’re not running against life, enjoy my art!”\n\n(Art? Is someone sellin’ art in the street like this?)\nHuh? Isn’t that Oshi-san’s friend一\n\n\nOya? Oya Oya Oya? It looks like we’ve met in an unexpected place, Doll-san!\n\nNna? I’m happy ya call me like that, but I’m not a doll anymore.\nNow, I need t’ live as a proper human, as I vowed durin’ the Repayment Festival\n\nOh? We, fine, were not too involved with the repayment festival, so we didn’t know much about the details―\nSo that&#39;s how it ended up after all?\nShould this be said to be a non-normal act of Shu, or rather a normal one?\nThis is the type of contradiction that art holds\nThe more one pursues art, the loftier the work becomes, and the more distant it becomes from human beings. And it is only when humans determine its value that art can be considered art\nAn artist truly is a thin, transparent thread that connects never-changing eternity to our own transient world! Amazing...☆\n\nNnha? Ok, if ya say so, but… What’re you doin’ here, Hibiki-senpai?\nIt looks like you’re doin’ a street performance or somethin’, but are you doin’ work around here?\n\nNo, no! Today is “Eichi Day”1, so I’m also enjoying my personal time!\n\nEichi Da–y?\n\nFufufu. It&#39;s a special and important holiday for us fine, don&#39;t you know?\n\nNo, I don&#39;t know. Now that I think about it, I think I read in a magazine article that the members of &quot;fine&quot; have been spendin’ their days off together\nI&#39;ve been doin’ a lot of gravure shoots lately, so I&#39;ve been gettin’ a lot of complimentary copies of the magazines I work for\n\nThat&#39;s right! We call that day off &quot;Eichi Day&quot;. It&#39;s a special code only known among us fine\n\nAhaha. As usual, it seems like the namin’ sense of the Student Council President’s exquisite, it was the same case fer DDD an’ MDM\nWait, that guy isn’t the President anymore. Eeh, ‘s Tenshouin Eichi-san, right?\nDoin’ something like namin’ a holiday after yerself just shows how he’s still trying to put himself in the spotlight somehow\n\nWell, Eichi is an idol after all, that’s our role. Maybe he was just influenced by me, who is always trying to be under the spotlight\n\nI mean, s’just bad pun usin’ holiday… From the “eh” in “H”- day t’Eichi-day. Sounds kinda dumb\n\nFufufu. Actually, he wasn’t the one who brought up the idea of calling it “Eichi day”\nWell, I won&#39;t deny that it&#39;s a very Eichi-esque name\nSpeaking of him, Eichi has been repeatedly admitted to and discharged from the hospital recently due to fatigue from the summer\nWe love to have Eichi by our side, but when he’s around, he acts tough and pushes himself too hard\nSo we are spending our time happily and joyfully, communicating with each other through Hall Hands and other means\nThe world is so beautiful and lovely, so please come back soon, Eichi\nFortunately or perhaps unfortunately, we’ve gotten used to Eichi&#39;s absence... Even without him, we have set up the activities of fine so that they can continue somehow\nIt&#39;s truly lonely and unfortunate. Just when we were about to start walking together, we had to separate\n\nFufu. Well, there’s nothin’ ya can do with his health the way it is\nLast year, we, Valkyrie, were both in bad condition too, an’ there were times when we couldn&#39;t perform on stages that we wanted t’ perform on\n\nFufufu. Such a thing is common amongst artists, isn’t it? They tend to put their whole heart and soul into the work in front of them, and forget about their own “self”\nEven though for us idols, our “self” is our selling point\n\n.....♪\n\nOya? What&#39;s wrong, why are you grinning? Did I say something amusing? Can you tell me what it is?\n\nNnha, ‘s not that… I was just thinkin’ about how easy it is to talk with ya, even though I’m shy when it comes to people &#39;m not that close to, Hibiki-senpai\nI guess ‘s because yer pretty similar to Oshi-san, bein’ his friend an’ all♪\n\nMe, similar to Shu? That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever been insulted in such a way, and I&#39;ll never forgive it! My beloved doves, teach that fool a lesson!\n\n\nAhhh!? I- I- I-I&#39;m sorry, ‘m so sorry! Don’t set yer doves on meee! How are ya even doin’ that!? Are you a circus animal tamer?\n\nFufufu. Doves are intelligent creatures, so if you train them well, you can control them however you like\nI personally hatched those pigeons from their eggs, fed them delicious meals, and taught them everything from how to stand to how to walk\n\nNnha~ So ’s like the way Oshi-san raised me, I suddenly feel like I have a real connection with them\n\nNo, in my eyes, me and Shu, and you and the doves are completely different\n\nNnha~ do ya hate t’ be compared with Oshi-san, Hibiki-senpai? Well, I guess y’all had a tough time two years ago\nY’all were thrown in the trash as &quot;things the world doesn&#39;t need”一\n\nGoodness, you&#39;re acting like it was someone else&#39;s business entirely. You were also a victim, but perhaps your sense of self had not yet developed at the time\nJust like your predecessor, the blonde-haired Doll-san\n\n........Are ya talkin’ about the stuff involvin’ Nazuna-nii? Or Mado-nee?\n\nIt could apply to both. Humans have a hard time telling the difference between male and female birds, because humans have a hard time becoming interested in or attached to things that are far away from us\nI believe that&#39;s why Shu made you into a &quot;human&quot;, you know\n\n...?\n\nChapter 2\n\nteste\n\n\n        ⌂\n        ←\n        ⌂\n        →\n        ↑\n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ During Tempest, fine members are working a lot and don’t have time to spend together, specially Eichi. So, as a solution, they create something called “Eichi Day”, a day off they would pass together."},{"title":"Translation Masterlist","url":"//translations/","content":"\nTerms of Service\nPlease, before checking my translations, read my terms of service!\nI permit:\nTaking Screenshots of my translations\nRe-translating my translations to a different language, but please contact me in Twitter/X (koou210), or in my Discord (koou21)\nUsing my translations for Youtube Videos, but of course giving me the credits\nUsing my translations in Fanworks, Quotebooks, but please give me the credit\nUsing my translations on public/private masterlists\n\nI do not permit:\nMaking any tip of profit with my translations\nRe-publishing the enterity of a translaion in other places, without my previous agreement\nTrain any type of AI with my translations\nChanging the meaning/intention in my translations\n\nMasterlist\n!!-Era\nMain Story\n\n  \n    \n        \n    \n      \n        Metamorphose\n        \n      \n  \n\nEvent Stories\n\n  \n    \n        \n    \n      \n        Neverland\n        \n      \n  \n\nIdol Stories\n\n  \n    \n        \n    \n      \n        Coffin Dilemma\n        \n      \n  \n  \n    \n        \n    \n      \n        Shoe Sores and Aching Muscles\n        \n      \n  \n  \n    \n        \n    \n      \n        One Single Person\n        \n      \n  \n\nSpecial Stories\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n            \n                PM6:∞\n                \n            \n    \n\nOther Stories\n\n  \n    \n        \n    \n      \n        Valkyrie Anniversary Mini Talks\n        \n      \n  \n  \n    \n        \n    \n      \n        Double Face Anniversary Mini Talks\n        \n      \n  \n  \n    \n        \n    \n      \n        MaM Anniversary Mini Talks\n        \n      \n  \n\nSong Lyrics\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n            \n                Stippling\n                \n            \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n            \n                =EYE=\n                \n            \n    \n\n!-Era\nManagement Stories\n\n  \n    \n        \n    \n      \n        Management Story -
